"JS - Beginners - 11 Chapters - Source - Code" 
In this JS tuts I added 11 Chapters of all JS codes, afer learning this goto my Fourth repo jQuery-from-scratch

Note : The 7 and 8 Chapters is include in AJAX and JSON tuts. so you can find it on there

Suggest : Learn first 1 to 6 than goto jQuery-from-scratch learn 7, than goto AJAX and JSON tuts for chapter 8, after start learning 9 to 17 of JS-from-scratch
